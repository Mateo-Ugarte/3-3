    <p class="writing"> Steve Jobs helped found Apple, but he also changed electronics forever. In addition to the Apple computers, he created the iPod, iPad, and iPhone. In 1988, he released the iMac, now known as the MacBook. The computer sold about 5 million units within 3 years of it's launch. He changed what people thought computers were, making them smaller than before. He also made them more affordable and cheaper to buy, with the iMac costing $1,299, while alternatives cost over $1,700. He also bought Pixar in 1986, which is now known as an innovative and critically aclaimed animation studio. Without Steve Jobs, electronics may not be like how they are now, with him and Apple changing the industry forever.</p>
